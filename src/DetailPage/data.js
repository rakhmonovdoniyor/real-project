            comfort1: "Size and Layout: Larger camping cars generally offer more space and comfort, but they can be more challenging to maneuver and park. The layout of the interior also plays a crucial role in comfort. Well-designed layouts optimize space for living, sleeping, cooking, and storage. Maintaining a comfortable temperature inside the camping car is important, especially during extreme weather conditions. Climate control systems such as air conditioning and heating ensure that occupants can stay cool in hot weather and warm in cold weather",
